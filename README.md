First of all, you will need to get API key for YouTube search. Go to this website: (https://console.cloud.google.com/), login here and choose New project.

After choosing name, click Create and go to "APIs and services" and then to "Credentials". Or you can go here by clicking this URL (https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).

Here, click "Create credentials", choose API key and create it. Now, you will see API key 1. Click on "SHOW KEY" and copy the key.

Take this key and open file named key.txt in folder with program. Paste this key after `key=` and you are ready to go to the next part.

*(Congratulations, you managed to do the hardest part of all ðŸ˜„.)*

### Downloading packages
If you are using this program for the first time, you will need to download Python packages for this script to work. Simply open "Packages.bat" file and let the script download everything for you.

After downloading will end, you can close this script and ready to go using program â™¥.

## How to actually use SpotifyDownloader
To run the main script, you need to open "SpotifyDownloader.bat".

After opening it, it will ask you to login into your Spotify account. It will also open URL for login in your default web browser. After logging in, you have to press Enter in script and go to the next step.

Now, it's time for Spotify URL. This program can take any album or playlist URL (also private playlists, because you gave the program permissions to do so). After you paste URL here, click enter. Now, you have to wait for couple of seconds.

After some time, you will see first message. `Song named "name of your song" downloader`. From now, it will download all songs in the playlist. The script will automatically end after downloading all songs.

You can find songs in folder named `downloaded_songs`. There will be folder with name of your album/playlist and inside, there will be all songs downloaded.

## Limitations
Because I'm using Google's YouTube API, it has daily limit of 100 searches per day. That means, you can download only 100 songs a day.
